## Usage

### Uploading and Processing Videos

1. **Upload a Video**: Navigate to the upload section and select a ping pong game video.
2. **Process the Video**: The app will process the footage, detecting objects and events from the video.
3. **View Insights**:
    - **Detailed Game Metrics**: Access comprehensive game insights such as ball speed, longest rally, and scoring events overlaid on the video.
    - **Table Depth Analysis**: Utilize the **Table Depth Analysis** feature, which divides the table into **8 distinct sections**. This segmentation allows you to:
        - **Visualize Ball Impact Zones**: Identify where most of the ball hits occur on the table.
        - **Analyze Gameplay Patterns**: Understand player strategies and shot placements based on the depth distribution.
        - **Enhance Training Sessions**: Use the depth data to focus on specific areas of the table during practice.
        - **Compare Performance**: Evaluate consistency and accuracy in ball placement across different game sessions.


### Reviewing Game Statistics
- **Ball Speed**: Monitor the speed of the ball throughout the game.
- **Longest Rally**: Identify and review the longest rally achieved during the match.
- **Ball Tracking**: Visualize the ball‚Äôs trajectory with each bounce marked on the table.
- **Shot Accuracy**: Analyze heat maps and shot placement to improve your accuracy.
